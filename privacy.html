                    <h2>1. How I Use Information</h2>
                    <p>I use the information I receive in a variety of ways, the core of which is to improve my services. I may also use this information to maintain my services; to customize my service to meet your needs; to process transactions; to verify your identity and prevent fraudulent transactions; to provide customer support; and to contact you.</p>
                    
                    <p>Unless you ask me not to, I may contact you via email in the future to tell you about new services and other information I believe you would find valuable.</p>
                    
                    <p>Some cases but not limited to are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To provide and maintain my Service</li>
                        <li>To notify you about changes to my Service</li>
                        <li>To allow you to participate in interactive features of my Service when you choose to do so</li>

                        <li>To monitor the usage of my Service</li>
                        <li>To detect, prevent and address technical issues</li>
                        <li>To provide you with news, special offers and general information about other services which I offer</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>2. When I Share Information</h2>
                    <p>My policy is to maintain the confidentiality of the personally identifiable information of individuals except in cases when the law requires disclosure or when I have your permission to do so. Occasionally, I may share aggregated statistics of user behavior (e.g. usage patterns, user growth, etc.) with partners and other interested parties. This information will never identify any individual personally or contain any personally identifiable information.</p>
                    
                    <p>I do not sell, lease, share, rent, or otherwise provide any personally identifiable information for marketing purposes to any companies or persons outside of my services. I may provide your personally identifiable information to service providers and affiliates that provide services in conjunction with my offerings, such as payment processors, fraud protection services, or other parties assisting in improving my services.</p>
                    
                    <p>I will only disclose personally identifiable information to government officials and law enforcement agencies when it is required by law (e.g. in compliance with a subpoena or court order) or if I believe in good faith that such action is appropriate and necessary to protect and defend my rights, or to protect the safety of users, and the general public.</p>
                    
                    <h2>3. What Personal Data I Collect And Why I Collect It</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Comments</h3>
                    <p>When visitors leave comments on the site I collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor's IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Media</h3>
                    <p>If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Contact Forms</h3>
                    <p>When you submit contact forms, I collect the information you provide such as your name, email address, and message content to respond to your inquiries and provide the requested services.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Embedded Content from Other Websites</h3>
                    <p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.</p>
                    
                    <p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Automatic Collection Of Information</h3>
                    <p>When you visit the Website my servers automatically record information that your browser sends. This data may include information such as your device's IP address, browser type and version, operating system type and version, language preferences or the webpage you were visiting before you came to my Website, pages of my Website that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on my Website, access times and dates, and other statistics.</p>
                    
                    <p>Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding Website usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.</p>
                    
                    <h2>4. How Long I Retain Your Data</h2>
                    <p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so I can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.</p>
                    
                    <p>For users that register on my website (if any), I also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.</p>
                    
                    <h2>5. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
                    <p>I am a Data Controller of your information.</p>
                    
                    <p>My legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Information I collect and the specific context in which I collect the information:</p>

                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>I will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. I will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with my legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce my policies.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights. If you wish to be informed what Personal Information I hold about you and if you want it to be removed from my systems, please contact me.</p>

                        <li>The right to data portability</li>
                        <li>The right to withdraw consent</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>6. Log Files</h2>
                    <p>My website follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit websites. The information collected by log files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. The purpose of the information is for analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movement on the website, and gathering demographic information.</p>
                    
                    <h2>7. Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>
                    <p>Like any other website, my site uses 'cookies'. These cookies are used to store information including visitors' preferences, and the pages on the website that the visitor accessed or visited. The information is used to optimize the users' experience by customizing web page content based on visitors' browser type and/or other information.</p>
                    
                    <h2>8. Children's Information</h2>
                    <p>Another part of my priority is adding protection for children while using the internet. I encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.</p>
                    
                    <p>I do not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. If you think that your child provided this kind of information on my website, I strongly encourage you to contact me immediately and I will do my best efforts to promptly remove such information from my records.</p>
                    
                    <h2>9. Online Privacy Policy Only</h2>
                    <p>My Privacy Policy applies only to my online activities and is valid for visitors to my website with regards to the information that they shared and/or collect on my website.
